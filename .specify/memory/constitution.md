# Speech2TextContainer10 Constitution
<!-- Project governance for the Speech2TextContainer10 research spike -->

## Core Principles

### Minimal Dependencies Only
- Prefer the standard library and existing tooling; a new dependency MUST be justified in the plan with a clear experiment-driven need.
- Every added dependency MUST include a removal or retention decision in the closing report for the spike.
- Unused or speculative packages MUST be removed before concluding the spike.
*Rationale: Keeps the research spike lightweight and reduces future maintenance obligations.*

### Constrained Scope Delivery
- Implement only the behaviours listed in the active spec; any expansion requires written approval before work proceeds.
- Reuse simplest viable patterns and avoid creating new abstractions unless an existing file cannot express the change.
- Document deliberate exclusions so reviewers can confirm alignment with the spike goal.
*Rationale: Focused scope preserves velocity and prevents accidental long-term commitments.*

### Spike-Grade Quality Posture
- Security hardening, production observability, and exhaustive test suites are out of scope unless explicitly mandated by the spec.
- Capture known risks and unaddressed gaps in documentation to inform later hardening phases.
- Use lightweight instrumentation (console logs, timing snippets) only when it directly supports the research objective.
*Rationale: The spike prioritises learning over production readiness while keeping risks visible.*

### Integrity Proof Gates
- Before relying on tooling or services, run and record explicit checks (e.g., health endpoints, version prints) proving the environment behaves as expected.
- Include these checks in the plan and scripts so maintainers can reproduce them without guesswork.
- Block merge until all required integrity evidence is attached to the spec or research notes.
*Rationale: Early verification prevents wasted effort on misconfigured environments.*

### One-Test Validation
- Author exactly one automated or scripted test per distinct technical element (API call, parser, transform) introduced by the spike.
- Each test MUST demonstrate that the element works under nominal conditions; broader coverage is optional unless mandated.
- Record any intentionally skipped tests with justification in the spec to maintain traceability.
*Rationale: Minimal tests confirm the stack functions without slowing the spike with redundant coverage.*

## Research Spike Constraints
- Deliverables MUST emphasise findings, prototypes, and reusable notes instead of production assets.
- Assumptions, shortcuts, and deferred concerns MUST be captured in `/docs/` or spec addenda for future teams.
- Source artefacts SHOULD remain disposable: prefer scripts and notebooks over frameworks unless the plan documents a reuse case.

## Workflow Guardrails
- Plans MUST outline dependency justifications, scope boundaries, integrity checks, and the mapping of tests to technical elements.
- Specs MUST document explicit acceptance evidence for each integrity check and the reduced security posture.
- Task breakdowns MUST include one validation task per technical element and indicate which tasks fulfil each integrity proof gate.
- Reviews MUST confirm that emitted evidence (logs, screenshots, command outputs) is attached before sign-off.

## Governance
- Amendments require an issue describing the change, reviewer approval from project maintainers, and an updated sync impact report.
- Versioning follows semantic policy: MAJOR for principle removals or reversals, MINOR for new principles/sections or broadened scope, PATCH for clarifications.
- Compliance reviews occur during plan, spec, and PR stages; approvers MUST cite the relevant principle when flagging deviations and record accepted exceptions.
- The constitution supersedes conflicting guidance; runtime docs (README, `/docs/`) must stay consistent after each amendment.
