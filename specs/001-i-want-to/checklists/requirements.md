# Specification Quality Checklist: Azure Speech to Text Container CLI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec describes WHAT the system does (transcribe audio, validate environment, display results) without specifying HOW (programming languages, frameworks). References to Docker and Azure Speech are part of the required environment, not implementation choices.

✅ **User value focused**: All sections emphasize user benefits - transcribing meetings, validating setup, identifying speakers. Business value is clear throughout.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for stakeholders who understand the business need (demonstrating containerized Speech service) without requiring technical expertise.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections present and filled with concrete content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The spec makes informed assumptions about reasonable defaults (audio formats, authentication method, performance targets) and documents them in the Assumptions section.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be independently verified:
- FR-001: Check container version and language config
- FR-003: Execute CLI with file path argument
- FR-005: Verify stdout contains transcription text
- All requirements have clear pass/fail criteria

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC have specific metrics:
- SC-001: "10 minutes total time" - measurable
- SC-002: "30 seconds" - measurable
- SC-005: "90% of common failure scenarios" - quantifiable
- SC-007: "80%+ segment accuracy" - measurable

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: SC describe outcomes from user perspective without implementation details. Even SC-001 focuses on user experience (total time) rather than system internals.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path and variations.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Six edge cases listed covering format incompatibility, long files, unavailable services, invalid credentials, no-speech audio, and evidence capture during failures.

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear boundaries defined:
- Language: English only
- Environment: Local Docker (not cloud)
- Interface: CLI only (not GUI/web)
- Deferred concerns explicitly listed

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Comprehensive Assumptions section lists 9 prerequisites and environmental factors. Deferred Production Concerns identifies 6 areas intentionally out of scope.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements have acceptance criteria**: User stories provide acceptance scenarios that map to functional requirements. FR-003, FR-004, FR-005 are validated by User Story 1 acceptance scenarios.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: Three prioritized user stories cover:
- P1: Core transcription (must-have)
- P2: Environment validation (should-have)
- P3: Speaker diarization (nice-to-have)

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: Seven success criteria provide clear targets for feature completion. SC-001 through SC-006 apply to P1, SC-007 to P3.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec stays at the "what" level. References to specific technologies (Docker, Azure Speech v5.0.3) are requirements, not implementation choices.

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Strengths**:
- Well-prioritized user stories enable incremental delivery
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear separation of in-scope vs. deferred concerns
- Strong traceability between requirements, user stories, and success criteria

**No issues requiring updates**.
