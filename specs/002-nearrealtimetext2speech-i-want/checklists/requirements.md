# Specification Quality Checklist: NearRealTimeText2Speech

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality (Evaluation 2025-10-21, Revised)

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (user stories emphasize outcome & latency value).
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (technical metrics retained but phrasing generalized)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (latency metrics are generic; no flags or language names)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (once implemented & validated)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification now ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
